# multiplication-table-fun

I believe seeing number as quantities helps understand maths better.

I try to practice visual perception of maths with my two boys who are of primary school age. 

I have used small objects like pasta, popcorn kernels to help them understand and visualise multiplication table.

This app helps visualisation of multiplication table in terms of lots of the number(in-quantities).
